This is one of my favourite dishes: it tastes great and is very easy to cook. In Morocco it is prepared using a [tajine]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajine"), but you can use a small dutch oven or a heavy sauce pan with a lid. A lemon yoghurt dip is the perfect companion for this dish!

##Ingredients

###Meatballs
- 400g ground beef or lamb
- 2 onions
- 2 small cans of chopped tomatoes
- 50g bread crumbs
- 3-5 sage leaves
- 4 eggs
- fresh flat leaf parsley
- salt
- pepper
- cumin powder
- paprika
- 50 ml olive oil

###Yoghurt dip
- 500ml 
- juice of two lemons

##Cooking the Meatballs
Season the ground beef with some salt, pepper and paprika. Add the bread crumbs and chopped parsley and form 10-15 small meatballs. Put the dutch oven or pan on medium heat and add some olive oil. Fry the meatballs for approximately five minutes until they get a nice brown crust.

Remove the meatballs from the pan. Add some more olive oil, some salt, the chopped sage leaves, and a tablespoon of paprika and saut√© the  chopped onions for 10 minutes on low heat. Then add the tomatoes and put back the meatballs. Cover the pan and let everything simmer on low or medium heat for 20-30 minutes.

Meanwhile prepare the dip by adding the juice of two lemons, some salt and 1-2 teaspoons of cumin to the yoghurt. Put the dip in the fridge until you serve the dish.

When the meatballs are done and the oil begins to separate from the tomato sauce break the eggs and simply place them on top of the sauce. Close the lid, leave the pan on medium heat and wait for 5 minutes before serving with bread.

Enjoy!
