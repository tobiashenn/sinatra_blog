Cooking pork roast on a sunday morning is considered a very German thing. Here's a recipe to participate in this tradition:  

##Ingredients
- ½ kg pork loin
- 3 carrots
- 2 onions
- ⅔ pounds celery
- 2 tomatoes
- 2 garlic cloves
- salt
- pepper
- crushed coriander seeds
- ½ litter white wine
- olive oil

##Cooking the Pork Roast
Start by preheating your oven to 160°C-180°C. Chop the carrots, the celery and the onions roughly in ~3cm pieces. Next score the fatty side of the pork loin in a criss-cross pattern. Generously rub the pork with salt, pepper and the crushed coriander seeds.

Heat a heavy dutch oven. Once the dutch oven has reached a really high temperature cover the bottom with olive oil. Brown the roast for 3-5 minutes from each side, starting with the fat side down!

Remove the pork from the dutch oven. Sautée the chopped vegetables in the remaining olive oil and pork juice for several minutes. Then crush the garlic gloves and add them to the vegetables.

Put the pork back on top of the vegetables. Add the wine and the tomatoes. Cool the roast in the oven for 60-70 minutes. Cover the roast with watered parchment paper during the last 20 minutes if necessary.

You are done! I like to serve the roast with mashed potatoes and sautéed chard. Enjoy!
