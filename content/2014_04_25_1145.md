#Photo set: Riga
I have just spent some days in Riga - great city! Here are some shots I did while I was there. I tried to capture the "baltic feeling" and the special light that you can find up there. More photos in the [Riga photo set on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobiashenn/sets/72157644298443544/).
