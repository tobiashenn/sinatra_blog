#Photos explored at flickr

In the last month I was lucky enough to have to of my photos explored on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com). The [first photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tobiashenn/12265531396/) was taken from the top of [Victoria peak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Peak) and shows the stunnig skyline of Hong Kong.

Taking the [second photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tobiashenn/12904949835) required tons of luck. It shows the crowd in front of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre in Paris. Lucky enough, a nun showed up just in the right moment and the camera autofocus decided to lock on her. There are many details to look at in the crowd which makes this photo not beautiful, but really interesting.
