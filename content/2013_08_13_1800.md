This is an easy start for low-temperature BBQ and indirect grilling: the stuffing and the marinade prevent the meat from drying out and you will get a nice, juicy roast even if you don't have a thermometer to precisely control the grill and meat temperature. 

##Ingredients
- 700g pork loin
- 10 dried plums
- 1 onion
- butter
- 50ml soy sauce
- 50 olive oil
- paprika powder
- brown sugar
- honey
- salt
- kitchen twine

##Stuffing and Marinating the Meat
Prepare the marinade by mixing the olive oil, soy sauce, two teaspoons of brown sugar, two teaspoons of honey, and a teaspoon of paprika. Next coarsely chop the plums and the onions. Sauté the onions and the plums for ~ 5 minutes in some butter.

Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut a pocket in the pork loin. Try to cut the pocket such, that the meat at the remaining bottom is as thick as on the sides. Stuff the loin with the onions and the plums. Use some kitchen twine to tie the roast.

Place the roast together with ½ of the marinade in a bowl and sprinkle with a dash of salt. Keep the remaining marinade for later for glazing the roast while cooking.  Make sure that all parts of the roast are covered by the marinade. Leave the roast for a couple of hours in the fridge, but give it ~ 1 hour to reach room temperature before grilling.      

##Preparing the Grill
For the indirect cooking place a water pan in the middle of the Kettle grill. Fill the water pan with 2-3 cm of hot water. Use a simple chimney starter to light ~ 1kg of charcoal. When all coals are covered with white-gray ash place equal amounts on both sides of the water pan. Close the lid, open all vents, and pre-heat the grill for 10-15 minutes.
   
##Cooking the Loin
Start the grilling by placing the meat directly above the hot, red-glowing coals. Sear each side for 3-5 minutes. Next, remove the roast from the coals and place it in the middle of the grill above the water pan. Close the vents to ~½ of the maximum opening. With the lid closed, grill for ~ 80 minutes. Turn the roast every 20 minutes and brush with new marinade.

After removing the roast from the grill, wrap it in aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes. 

Enjoy your BBQ!
