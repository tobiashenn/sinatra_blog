#Sinatra based Blog Engine on GitHub

I recently started working on this site  - basically just to try & learn something new. The site is hosted at [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com "Heroku"). It is based on the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com "Sinatra") Ruby web framework. 

The heart of the site is the very simple blog engine. Content is written in simple time-stamped plain text [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") files. These files are converted to HTML on demand using the [rdiscount](https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount "RDsicount") Ruby gem.

I uploaded the source code of the whole site on [GitHub](https://github.com/tobiashenn/sinatra_blog "GitHub") -  it is still work in progress. Feel free to take a look if you are looking for a very simple, customisable blog engine!
