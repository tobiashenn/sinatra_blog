It's spring and the BBQ season is coming -  time to prepare some homemade hot sauces! This sauce combines the heat of Habanero peppers with the sweetness of caramelised pears. Try it, it's awesome! 

The recipe yields 4 x 250ml jars.  

##Ingredients
- 2 fresh pears
- 1 onion
- 1 lime
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 cloves
- 800ml apple vinegar or white balsamic vinegar
- 4-10 Habanero peppers  
- salt
- 1tbsp. paprika powder
- 1tbsp. ground cinnamon
- butter
- 100g brown sugar
- 50 ml whisky
- four empty 250ml canning jars 

##Cooking the Hot Sauce

###Sterilising the jars
Put the empty jars and lids in a pot and cover with hot water. Bring the water to boil and leave the jars in the simmering water while you cook the hot sauce.

###Caramelising the pears 
Peal the pears, remove the cores, and cut the pears in small ~ ½cm cubes. Finely chop the onion. Meanwhile, heat a sauce pan over medium heat. Add some butter and sauté the pears and onions for 5 to 10 minutes until both are soft.

Turn up the heat to high and add the brown sugar. Caramelise the pears and onions for 2-5 minutes. Stir from time to time to make sure that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan! Once the pears are nicely browned add the whisky and stir for 1 more minute.

###Blend & simmer
Add the vinegar, salt, paprika, ground cinnamon, cloves and cinnamon sticks. Cook the sauce for 10-15 minutes on medium heat. Remove the cloves and cinnamon sticks. Use a blender shaft to puree the hot sauce. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for 5 more minutes. Finally add the juice of the lime

###Filling the jars
As always: remove the jars from the boiling water and quickly fill them with the hot sauce. Close the lids and place the jars upside down until the sauce has cooled down.

You're done!
