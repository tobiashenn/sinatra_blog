It's BBQ season! Ready to grill some fish? Try the trout: It's easy to grill, tastes great and even does not cost a lot!

##Ingredients
- two small to medium sized trouts
- 1 lemon
- 2 rosemary branches
- fresh parsley
- salt
- pepper
- 2 garlic cloves
- 50 ml olive oil


##Preparing the grill and the trouts
I use a Weber kettle grill to cook the trouts. If you are going to only grill the trouts you will only need ~500g of charcoal or briquettes. Use the time it takes to light up your charcoals in the chimney to prepare the trouts. Start by slicing the lemon and chopping the garlic and the parsley. Put all in a small bowel and mix with the olive oil. 

Rinse the trouts with cold water. After drying the trouts with some paper towels, generously season the outside and inside with salt and pepper. Stuff the trouts with the garlic, parsley,lemon, and the rosemary branches. You can use some small metal skewers to close the trout and keep the stuffing fixed inside. Use the rest of to rub the outside of the trouts. This is important - the olive oil will prevent the skin of the trouts from sticking to your grill!

##Grilling the trouts
Grilling the trouts is easy as long as you stick to one rule: use medium to high heat and **only turn the trouts once**! Once your charcoals are ready evenly spread them in your grill, close the lid and wait for 5-10 minutes. When the grill has reached high temperature directly place the trouts over the hot charcoals. Close the lid and wait for **4 minutes**. Keep the lid closed and do not move the trouts. Enjoy the great smell while waiting…

After four minutes open the grill and gently flip the trouts. Close the lid and grill the other side for another **4 minutes**. 

Your dinner is ready! The trout meat is juicy and full of the flavors of the stuffing -  enjoy!
