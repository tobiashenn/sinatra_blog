This is a recipe for Stifado, a Greek beef stew. The taste of the stew is exceptional: you marinate the beef for 12 hours in red wine and vinegar with ***cinnamon*** and ***cloves***. This is, by far, my favourite stew recipe! 

##Ingredients & supplies

- 600g lean beef, cut into ~ 3cm pieces
- ½ litre red wine
- 4 onions
- 3 garlic cloves
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 10 cloves
- 1 tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 3 bay leafs 
- salt, pepper & allspice grains
- olive oil
- 30ml aceto balsamico

##Cooking Stifado

###Marinating the beef
Before cooking the stew the beef should be marinated for 6 to 12 hours. Put the beef in a bowl. Add 2 tbsp. olive oil, the balsamic vinegar and the red wine. Also add the bay leafs, cinnamon sticks, cloves, brown sugar, the garlic and some allspice grains. Use a heavy kitchen knife to crush the garlic. Add salt and pepper. Thoroughly mix the beef with the marinade and make sure that every piece is covered (see picture above…). Place the meat in the fridge, ideally over night.

###Cooking the stew
Use a sieve to separate the beef from the marinade. Make sure to save the marinade (including the cinnamon sticks and bay leaves) for later, it will yield the sauce!

Generously cover the bottom of a Dutch oven with olive oil and turn on high heat. Cut the onions in half. Fry the onions in the olive oil for some minutes until they are nicely browned. Next, add the meat and the tomato paste and fry for some more minutes.

Add the marinade and a can of diced tomatoes. Close the lid of the Dutch oven and let the stew simmer on low heat for 2 hours. Open the lid during the last ~ 30 minutes to reduce the sauce to the desired degree. The meat will be very tender and the sauce is phenomenal… 

Enjoy!
