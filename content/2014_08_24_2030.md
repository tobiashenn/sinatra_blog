#Photo set: NYC and Road Trip "American South"
Before attending a semiconductor physics conference in Texas I first took a short trip to New York City and then did a road trip starting in Florida. The road trip took me from Miami (with two visits to the Everglades and the Keys) to Tallahassee, Panama City, New Orleans, and finally to Austin.
