This [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tobiashenn/sets/72157637169824214/) is my first attempt at long exposure photography. I have  taken some pictures at the beach of Barcelona using a 1000x OD 3.0 neutral density glass filter and a 35mm lens. At ISO 100 and around f/10 the filter allowed me to expose for 20 to 30 seconds. Unfortunately I did not have a tripod with me so I had to place my camera at the pier which limited the framing possibilities.
