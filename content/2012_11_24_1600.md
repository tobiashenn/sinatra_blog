Some days ago I prepared a sweet Garlic Habanero Hot sauce. Here's the recipe:  

##Ingredients & supplies

- 12 Habanero pods
- ½ liter apple vinegar
- 3 tablespoons of brown sugar
- 8 garlic chives
- 50ml brandy or rum
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 50g honey
- 6 to 16 Habanero peppers  
- 1 lemon or lime
- brown sugar
- one empty 500ml bottle 

##Cooking the hot sauce

###Sterilising the Bottle

Start by placing the glass bottle in hot water. Bring the water to boil and cook the bottle for 25 minutes while preparing the hot sauce.

###Roasting the Habaneros
I used fresh Choclat Habaneros for this hot sauce. you can also use yellow, orange or red Habaneros. Remove the stems from the Habanero pods. Cut the Habaneros in half and remove the seeds and membranes.

Peel the garlic and crush the chives with a heavy knife. Next prepare a marinade for the chills and the garlic. Put the brown sugar and the honey in a bowl.

Add the Brandy or rum to the bowl. You can also try using Bourbon… Stir the marinade until the honey and sugar are dissolved. Add the crushed garlic and the Habaneros to the bowl. Make sure that all parts are covered with the marinade.

Let the Habaneros and the garlic marinade while you preheat your oven to 180°C. Once the oven is read, remove the Habaneros and the garlic from the marinade and place them on a griddle. Keep the remaining marinade for later. Place the griddle in the top drawer of your oven. Roast for 10-15 minutes until the garlic and chills are nicely browned.

###Blend & simmer
Put the roasted Habaneros and the garlic in a blender. Add the apple vinegar, the remaining marinade and a teaspoon of salt to the blender.

Blend for 30-60 seconds until the garlic and Habaneros are finely chopped. Place the mixture in a sauce pan and add a cinnamon stick.

Bring the sauce to boil and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. Then add the juice of a fresh lime or lemon.


###Filling the bottle
Remove the glass bottle from the water bath. Fill the hot sauce in the glass bottle while both are hot. Close the bottle and leave it upside-down until it has cooled down. You're done! Enjoy your hot sauce!
