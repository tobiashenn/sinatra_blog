#The Fujinon XF23mmF1.4 R

 Much has been said about the optical quality of the [Fujinon XF23mmF1.4 R lens](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/) (excellent sharpness, nice bokeh, and the virtual absence of distortion and chromatic aberration). I here take another approach and simply share some photos I have taken recently that illustrate the versatility of this amazing lens.

Obvious use cases for the 23mm focal length are street, nature, and landscape photography.

The 23mm focal length is also a natural choice for documentary style photography.
