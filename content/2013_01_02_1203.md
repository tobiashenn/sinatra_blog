title: Analyze .tcx GPS traces using Ruby and Matlab
---

A year ago I started logging my running with GPS. Since January 2012 I use my phone and the [Runtastic app](http://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/runtastic "Runtastic") to record traces of most of my runs. 

From the runtastic web site you can export the raw GPS traces of your runs in a variety of formats. I decided to download all the raw traces and produce some statistics on my 2012 running activities.

I used the [.tcx format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML "GPX exchange format") for the simple reason that Runtastic includes the total distance and duration of the run in the .tcx files so you don't have to analyse the raw GPS data on your own to obtain this information.

I wrote a simple Ruby script which allows the automated import of a bunch of .tcx files. For each run the script extracts basic information like the date of the run, the distance and the duration. A summary of this data can then be exported to a simple ASCII file and processed using your statistics tool of choice. You can find the script on [GitHub](https://github.com/tobiashenn/tcxGPSimporter "tax").

I then used Matlab to create some [statistics on my 2012 running](http://tobi.site44.com/running2012/running2012.html). You can clearly see that I was not always running on my own...
