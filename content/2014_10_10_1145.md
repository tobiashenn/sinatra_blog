#Prism
This is the heart of the picosecond MOKE microscope that I have build during my Phd. The photo shows the prism selector which is used to slice spectrally narrow parts from the output of a pulsed ultrafast 'white light' supercontinuum laser source. This spectral slice is used to image the motion of electron spins in semiconductors. Looks neat, too!
