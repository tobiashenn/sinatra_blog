Nothing better than a bunch of hot roulades on a cold sunday evening! A small detour from the classical recipe  - adding dried plums - makes them even greater! Here is how you can make your own:

##Ingredients & supplies

- 4 thin beef roulades
- 12 strips of bacon
- ½ litre red wine
- 10 dried plums
- 2-3 small pickled cucumbers
- 4 onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 3 carrots
- mustard
- 1 tbsp. tomato paste
- bay leaf 
- salt, pepper & allspice grains
- olive oil
- wooden toothpicks
- optional: 200ml homemade beef stock concentrate

##Cooking the roulades

###Preparing the roulades

Start by thoroughly cleaning the roulades. Sprinkle the top side of the roulades with salt and pepper. Spread some mustard on each roulade and add three bacon strips on top. Chop one of the onions, the pickled cucumbers and the dried plums. Place the chunky diced stuffing on top.

Roll the roulades. Use (plenty of…) wooden toothpicks to hold the roulades together. That's it - they are ready to go!

###Searing the roulades

Generously cover the bottom of a heavy saucepan with olive oil and turn on high heat. Once the oil is hot place the roulades in the pan. Sear every side for 2-3 minutes. Fry only two at a time if your pan is too small. Be careful when flipping them - they tend to stick to the bottom of the pan. Remove from the pan once the roulades have a nice brown color.

###Preparing the sauce

Cut the remaining onions and the carrots in ~5cm pieces. Use a heavy knife to crush the garlic cloves. Fry in the same sauce pan for 3-5 minutes until the onions are nicely browned. Add the tomato paste and fry for 2 more minutes. Next place the roulades on top, deglaze with the red wine. Add the beef stock, bay leaf and some allspice grains. If necessary add some more wine - all roulades should be covered.

Close the lid of the sauce pan and bring the sauce to the boil. Then reduce the heat and let simmer for 60 minutes. Turn the roulades from time to time.

Open the lid and let simmer for ~30 more minutes. Your roulades are ready! 

P.S.: Roulades are (of course) best enjoyed with [Spätzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spätzle "Spätzle")…
