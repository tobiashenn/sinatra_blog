##Cooking the chutney

###Sterilising the jars
Start by placing the empty jars in a pot and cover them with hot water. Also add the jar lids to the pot. Bring to boil and leave the jars in the simmering water while you cook the chutney.

###Roasting the pineapples and Habaneros

Preheat your oven to 180°C. Remove the top and bottom of the pineapple and cut it lengthwise in quarters. Remove the hard core. Cut the pineapple in thin splices and spread them on a baking tray. Sprinkle the slices generously with brown sugar. Cut Habaneros in half and place them on the baking tray. You can remove the membranes and seeds if you want to reduce the heat of the chutney. Crush the garlic gloves with a knife and add to the tray.

Place the tray for 10-15 minutes in the top drawer of your oven. Remove the tray when the Habaneros and the pineapple pieces are nicely caramelised.

###Cooking the mango, carrots and the onion
Chop the onion and the carrot and place in a pan. Add some oil and sauté the vegetables for several minutes. Peel the mango and cut the soft parts of the fruit in small pieces. Put the mango pieces, the caramelised Habaneros and the pineapple slices in the pan. Add the vinegar and let simmer for approximately 5-10 minutes. Also add some salt. Use an immersion blender to purée the chutney. Add the juice of the limes to the pan and let simmer for 5 more minutes.

###Filling the jars

Remove the jars from the boiling water. Fill the jars with the chutney until tippy and immediately close them with the jar lids. Put the jars upside down until they have cooled down. You're done! Enjoy the chutney!
