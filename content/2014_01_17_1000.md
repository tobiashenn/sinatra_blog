#ImageBoard! on GitHub

I have started developing **ImageBoard!**, a small Sinatra-based Ruby web application for simple Image posting similar to *Instagram*.

Today I have made public the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tobiashenn/image_board), feel free to take a look!

The app currently provides user authentication and registration, image upload & storage, comments and favs. 

Even if you are not specifically interested in image sharing, you can probably still find many components which you can adapt and re-use in your own projects.

The Ruby server currently runs on my DigitalOcean host also used for this site. However, all images are stored remotely at Amazon S3.

The main purpose of this project for me is learning to develop simple web applications. This is an self-education project. **If you find horrible bugs, security flaws, design decisions etc. please let me know!**
